Hello. This is my first line of code I am going to write.

I am a devops enginner and soon I will be working on a big project I have never imagined in my life.

My life going to be according to my wish and I am going to change a hell lot of things. And it's working for me very well.

I truely beleive now all the things that have worked and not worked are working in my favour for now, I am enjoying  the process of becoming the Devops enginner.
